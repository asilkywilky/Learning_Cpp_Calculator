# Learning C++ by Making a Command Line Calculator

I recently wrote a simple command line calculator in C++ to learn the differences between C++ and Rust. There were arguments in my feed about which language is better, and I couldn't relate to what was being said. To understand the arguments, I decided to learn both languages. In the process, I utilized a couple of standard libraries and the command line to compile and run executables.

# Environment

I used the GCCompiler with MinGW to make my program and I used standard C++ libraries to interact with the command line and perform math operations.

# Future Work

- I plan to continue exploring low-level aspects of C++.
- I will learn and compare the differences between C++ and Rust.
- Later when I understand all the essentials I aim to create a high-quality product that I would actually use.
